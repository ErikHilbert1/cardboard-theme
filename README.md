# Name
When I first made this theme, I wanted it to have a resemblance to have a paper-y feel. Unfortunately, (fortunately?,) "paper" as a theme name was already taken. Thus, cardboard. 

# Installation
I'm probably going to try making an installation script for this eventually, but for now, you have to manually copy the files to where they should be or add them to your configuration. 

If you're using lf and foot, make sure that the previewer script is executable so that you can preview your pictures :)
If you're not using foot, in addition to background and text colours, make sure that terminal colours 16=#b3b5b2 17=#cccac2 for bash prompt and vim bar/numbers to look right.

# Firefox
Currectly, it is kind of ugly, sorry. Hopefully, it will be better soon.

# Icons
I might make some in the future for this theme when I have the time.
